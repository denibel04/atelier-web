                    <p>Are athletes athletes from the moment they're born? What about astronauts or idols? These things aren't decided at birth. So then… <strong><em>What about witches?</em></strong> In a world where everyone takes wonders like magic spells and dragons for granted, Coco is a girl with a simple dream: <em>she wants to be a sorceress. </em> 
                    <br><br>However, everyone knows that witches are born, not made, <em>and Coco he was not born with the gift of magic.</em> For this reason, Coco had given up on her dream... until, one fine day, the magician Qifrey visited her mother's workshop. Then she manages to spy on him as he is about to cast a spell and... <strong>Despair turns to hope in this tale about a girl who dreams of becoming a sorceress!</strong>
                    <br><br> Coco sees her wish fulfilled <em>at the horrid cost of her mother getting turned to stone. </em>Subsequently, she is taken in by Qifrey and, instead of having her memory erased, is allowed to learn the ways of rune magic, which gains her a dubious reputation in the magic community. While initially clumsy and naive, she is very enthusiastic about learning all she can about magic.</p>

Qifrey is a caring and patient teacher who understands the individuality of his students. This is especially true for <b> Coco </b>, who has no special abilities as a witch at first, but he continues to encourage her until she can draw magic skillfully. He is protective of all his disciples, as seen from how he protects them from being taken by <b> Easthies </b> and the <b>Knights Moralis.</b><br> <br> Qifrey hates water and getting wet, stating that the reason he became so skilled with <b>water magic</b> was because he wanted to avoid getting wet by controlling the water with spells.<br> <br> </p>

                    <p><strong>Olruggio <em>(オルーギオ)</em></strong> is a witch specializing in <b> fire magic </b> who serves as the <b> Watchful Eye </b> for Qifrey's atelier. He has a gruff way of speaking but his magic is often described as "warm." He has created a lot of <b> magical items</b>, such as the Glowstone Path, the Snugstone and the Searneedle Wand. <br><br>Qifrey and Olruggio are <b> childhood friends </b>, and seem to trust each other dearly. Despite being the Atelier's Watchful Eye and being sworn to report wrongdoings to the Knights Moralis, Olruggio trusts Qifrey to the point where he breaks this oath multiple times— like when he doesn't take Coco away after discovering she was an outsider to witch society.</p>
